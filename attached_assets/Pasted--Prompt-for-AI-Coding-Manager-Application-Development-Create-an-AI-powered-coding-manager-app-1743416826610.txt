**Prompt for AI Coding Manager Application Development:**

Create an AI-powered coding manager application that integrates seamlessly with the Cursor AI code editor. The application must fulfill the following requirements:

1. **Website Preview Functionality:**
   - Implement a feature that allows the AI coding manager to preview the website in a development environment.
   - Ensure the ability to view real-time changes as code is modified.

2. **Functionality Testing:**
   - Develop automated testing capabilities to interact with the website as a user would.
   - Include mechanisms to check for proper functionality, ensuring all features work as intended.

3. **Error Detection and Reporting:**
   - Integrate a bug identification system that detects malfunctions within the website code.
   - Enable the AI coding manager to analyze console logs and identify errors or bugs.
   - Provide detailed feedback to the AI agent for fixes required.

4. **Prompt Generation for Cursor AI:**
   - Design the AI coding manager to generate clear and concise prompts based on user input.
   - Ensure prompts direct the Cursor AI to execute specific coding tasks or fixes automatically.

5. **Integration with Version Control:**
   - Include functionality for the AI coding manager to advise on version control operations such as rolling back changes or committing updates to GitHub.
   - Allow the AI to suggest improvements for better code practices or application performance.

6. **Automatic Operations:**
   - Ensure that all actions performed by the AI coding manager, including sending prompts to the Cursor AI and interacting with the website, are executed automatically without manual intervention.
   - Design the system to handle user inputs that vary from single-line prompts to comprehensive specifications.

7. **User Feedback Loop:**
   - Implement a feedback system that allows the AI agent to learn from previous interactions and continuously improve its performance based on user specifications and encountered errors.

The application must prioritize efficiency, accuracy, and user experience, allowing developers to streamline their workflow and enhance productivity during the website development process.
